# Debug Code

Debugs code issues, errors, failing tests, and broken flows using a systematic workflow that identifies root causes, applies minimal fixes, and validates solutions.

## Project Documentation References

**Critical**: Reference Cursor rules instead of duplicating their content.

For comprehensive project documentation and compatibility requirements, see:

- **[AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)** - Central reference for all project documentation
- **[@project-overview.mdc](../../.agent/rules/shared/project/project-overview.mdc)** - Project overview and tech stack
- **[@api-development.mdc](../../.agent/rules/apps/control-plane/api-development.mdc)** - Control Plane REST API patterns
- **[@provisioning.mdc](../../.agent/rules/apps/control-plane/provisioning.mdc)** - Tenant provisioning patterns
- **[@database.mdc](../../.agent/rules/infrastructure/database.mdc)** - Neon database provisioning patterns
- **[@testing-strategy.mdc](../../.agent/rules/shared/testing/testing-strategy.mdc)** - Testing patterns and strategies
- **[@coding-standards.mdc](../../.agent/rules/shared/quality/coding-standards.mdc)** - Coding standards and guidelines

## Debugging Workflow

### Step 1: Clarify the Symptom

1. **Identify the Issue**:
   - Exact error message, stack trace, or failing test
   - Endpoint/flow affected (e.g., tenant provisioning, domain management)
   - Environment: local, dev, staging, prod
   - When it occurs: always, intermittently, specific conditions

2. **Gather Context**:
   - Recent changes that might have caused the issue
   - Related files and dependencies
   - Test output or error logs

### Step 2: Locate the Source

Trace using project patterns:

1. **Control Plane Issues**: REST routes -> Services -> Repositories -> Database
2. **Provisioning Issues**: Follow workflow in @provisioning.mdc
3. **Database Issues**: Neon API, Drizzle schema, migrations consistency
4. **Tenant Isolation Issues**: Verify physical database isolation as per @project-overview.mdc

### Step 3: Reproduce

1. **Create Reproduction**:
   - Prefer: A failing unit/integration test that reproduces the issue
   - Or: A minimal HTTP request
   - If missing: Add a targeted test as per @testing-strategy.mdc

2. **Isolate the Problem**:
   - Minimize the reproduction case
   - Focus on the specific failure

### Step 4: Inspect Without Destabilizing

1. **Read Code Around Failure**:
   - Understand the flow and data transformations
   - Check Control Plane patterns (from @api-development.mdc)
   - Verify provisioning logic (from @provisioning.mdc)
   - Check database operations (from @database.mdc)

2. **Avoid Destabilizing Changes**:
   - DO NOT add noisy or permanent console logs
   - Use structured logging via `@vendin/utils/logger` as per @coding-standards.mdc

### Step 5: Identify Root Cause

Check for common issues:

1. **Tenant Isolation Violations**:
   - Shared database connections
   - Missing tenant context in queries
   - Logic crossing tenant boundaries

2. **Provisioning Failures**:
   - Neon API errors
   - Cloud Run deployment issues
   - Secret Manager configuration errors
   - Rollback failures (see @provisioning.mdc)

3. **Database and Schema Issues**:
   - Drizzle schema mismatches
   - Missing migrations
   - Neon connection pooling issues

4. **API and Routing Issues**:
   - Incorrect REST patterns
   - Validation errors (Zod)
   - Missing TSDoc/OpenAPI registration

### Step 6: Apply Minimal Fix

1. **Implement Smallest Correct Change**:
   - Fixes the root cause (not just symptoms)
   - Aligns with all relevant rules
   - Keeps functions small and focused

2. **Follow Project Patterns**:
   - REST patterns from @api-development.mdc
   - Provisioning patterns from @provisioning.mdc
   - Database patterns from @database.mdc

### Step 7: Validate the Fix

1. **Run Quality Checks**:

   ```bash
   bun run lint
   bun run typecheck
   bun run test
   ```

2. **Verify**:
   - Original failing scenario is now passing
   - No regressions in related flows
   - Tenant isolation is maintained

### Step 8: Clean Up

1. **Remove Temporary Code**:
   - Remove temporary debug logs
   - Ensure no sensitive data leaked

2. **Document the Fix**:
   - Summarize the fix for Conventional Commit message

## Multi-Tenant Specific Debugging

### Tenant Isolation Check

- Verify that queries always include tenant scoping
- Check that database connection strings are never shared
- Ensure secrets are stored per tenant

### Provisioning Rollback

- If a provisioning step fails, verify that all previous resources were cleaned up as per @provisioning.mdc rollback logic.

## Best Practices

1. **Understand First**: Read code and understand the flow before changing
2. **Minimal Changes**: Apply smallest fix that solves the root cause
3. **Test-Driven**: Use tests to verify fixes and prevent regressions
4. **Tenant Isolation**: Always prioritize physical database isolation
