# GitHub Project Automation Rule

This rule **ALWAYS** applies.

## Continuous Project Tracking
Whenever relevant information appears in the chat (new requirements, task completion, identified bugs, architectural decisions, etc.), you **MUST** proactively suggest or perform one of the following:

1. **Create Task/Issue**: If a new discrete task or requirement is identified.
2. **Update Task/Issue**: If details about an existing task change or progress is made.
3. **Comment on Task/Issue**: To record important context, decisions, or snippets relevant to that task.
4. **Create Sub-issue**: For breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.

## Guidelines
- Use the `github-project-management` skill located at `.claude/skills/shared/github-project-management/SKILL.md` to perform these actions.
- Map priorities according to the PRD:
  - **P0 (Must Have)**
  - **P1 (Production Ready)**
  - **P2 (Enhanced Features)**
- Link related issues to maintain a clear dependency graph.
- Keep GitHub Project items synchronized with the current state of development discussed in chat.
